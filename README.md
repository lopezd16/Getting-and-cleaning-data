You will find the instructions on how to run analysis on Human Activity recognition dataset.

Dataset - Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones

Files
CodeBook
Here you will find the variables, data, and transformations to clean up the data.

run_analysis.R
Here you will find all the steps created in R described in the assignment(5 steps)
1.-Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
2.-Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
3.-Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
4.-Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
5.-From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
